ArcticMC is a media viewer/player that delegates video playback to VLC. The
primary use case is tracking which files are watched and which are not by
adding a "âœ“" character to the file/folder name.

At the moment, the main user interface is the command line based TUI. You can
run this interface by cloning the project, installing dependencies, then
running `mix run --no-start cli.exs`. A graphical user interface is in the
works.
